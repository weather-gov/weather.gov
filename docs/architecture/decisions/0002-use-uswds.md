# 2. We will use the US Web Design System

## Context

Using a design system can eliminate a ton of work for creating a new product.
If that design system is also built for accessibility and includes additional
features to make accessible design easier, that is an even bigger win.

Design systems help create a consistent user experience by establishing a color
palette, defining reusable components, and providing UX patterns for common
tasks.

Furthermore, the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text)
requires that all federal websites comply with the [standards defined by the US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/).

## Decision

We have chosen to use the US Web Design System (USWDS). USWDS satisfies the
legal requirement of the 21st Century IDEA act, is well-known to our team, and
has a significant focus on accessibility.

## Consequences

We may have to layer some customizations on top of USWDS, but that's normal.

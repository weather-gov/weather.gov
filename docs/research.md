<h1> How has research been involved in informing the weather.gov 2.0 design? </h1>

* Understanding the challenges that both internal and external users experience through open-ended “generative” research 
* Understanding the ins and outs of the existing systems through onsite visit 
* Getting quick feedback on in-progress designs and prototypes from folks that will use the website
* Designing and implementing internal and external surveys to get continuous feedback

| R4- Usability (CMS, forecasters) | Apr 2024 | All forecasters required assistance to find the right content | Most forecasters stated that it was easy to use (avg 2/5 rating with 1 being easiest).

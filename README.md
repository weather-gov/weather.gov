# Weathergov 2.0
## Running

After you have cloned the repository, you can run `just zap` to set up the containers. Visit [http://localhost:8080]() to see the application live once the containers are running. Visit [http://localhost:8081]() to see the API proxy's status once the containers are running.


## Documentation

The project documentation is built with MkDocs. You can read the guides in the `docs/` directory or serve them locally for a better reading experience.

To run the documentation server:
```bash
npm run docs:serve
# OR
just serve-docs
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the docs.

The `serve-docs` command automatically runs a documentation update script (`scripts/update-docs.js`) before starting the server. This script ensures that the "Code organization" section in the README and the "Performance Results" in the Interop documentation are always up-to-date with the codebase.

The documentation covers:
- **[Getting Started](./docs/dev/index.md)**: Setup, Docker, and Just commands.
- **[API Interop Layer](./docs/interop/index.md)**: Technical details and schemas.
- **[Development](./docs/dev/index.md)**: Standards, testing, and debugging.
- **[Architecture](./docs/architecture/decisions/)**: Decision records.
- **[Changelog](./docs/CHANGELOG.md)**: Project history.

## Development

### Conventional Commits & Changelog

We use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** to automate our changelog generation.
- **Main Changelog**: Run `npm run changelog` to update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (uses [conventional-changelog-cli](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli)).
- **Branch Changelog**: Run `npm run changelog:branch` to generate a cumulative changelog for your current working branch.

## Code organization

## Historical Note

This git repository is the second of iteration Weathergov 2.0 in git. The previous repository housed our codebase in Drupal; this repo was created for the migration to Wagtail/Django.

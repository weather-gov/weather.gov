        "description": "Elevated fire weather conditions are expected today across most\nof Maryland, eastern West Virginia, and Virginia.\n\nRelative humidity values are expected to drop back to around 20 to\n25 percent this afternoon, with some areas possibly seeing\nrelative humidity values below 20 percent for a couple of hours.\nWest wind gusts 15 to 20 mph in the valleys, and 20 to 25 mph on\nthe eastern slopes of the mountains. Gusts could occasionally be\nclose to 30 mph. This will result in the continued drying of fine\nfuels.\n\nResidents and visitors are urged to exercise caution if handling\nopen flames or equipment that creates sparks. Also, dispose of\ncigarette butts, matches, and other flammable items in appropriate\ncontainers. Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans.\nMost dry grasses, dead leaves, and other tree litter could easily\nignite and spread fire quickly.\n\nFor more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions,\nand wildfire prevention and education, please visit your state's\nforestry or environmental protection website.",

Dispose of cigarette buttes,\nmatches, and other flammable materials in appropriate containers.\nKeep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans. Most dry\ngrasses, dead leaves, and other tree litter could easily ignite\nand spread fire quickly. Refer to your local burn-permitting\nauthority on whether you may burn today.",

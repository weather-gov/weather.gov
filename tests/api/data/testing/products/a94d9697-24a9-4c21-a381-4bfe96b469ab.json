High pressure gradually builds across through mid week.\nHigh pressure will remain the predominate feature Thursday \nthrough much of the weekend. High pressure may lose hold as weak\nlow pressure passes to our north late Sunday into early next \nweek.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...\nAn upper level low slides across the Eastern Great Lakes and pivots \ninto Upstate New York. The lower and middle levels by and large will \ncontinue to dry out with a noticeably drier NW flow regime setting \nup across the area. The most noticeable change is the lowering of \ndew points across the region from west to east throughout today and \ninto tonight. Dew points fall into the much more comfortable 50s \ntoday, with some dew points getting into the upper 40s across \nnorthern and northwestern areas tonight. With the cooler air mass in \nplace and scattered to broken clouds indicated by BUFKIT profiles \nand steep low level lapse rates, expect temperatures to reach the \nmainly the middle 70s today, with a few pockets of lower 70s in \nspots resulting in temperatures a good 5 to 10 degrees below \naverage. The lower levels should be dry enough for today into \ntonight to preclude any rain shower activity despite some spokes of \nupper level energy from the upper level low swinging through.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...\nThe upper and mid level trough axis will swing through during \nWednesday. Despite this, predominantly dry weather continues \nfor the mid week. There is only a slight chance of a few widely\nscattered showers for mainly northern locations Wed afternoon.\nOtherwise, mainly just some low level fair weather clouds can \nbe expected from time to time with the lower and mid levels \nbeing relatively dry and synoptic scale sinking motion \nincreasing overall as high pressure will continue to gradually \nbuild from the west. Dew point readings will remain in the \ncomfortable 50s providing seasonably cool weather for this time \nof year. Day time temperatures will be close to 10 degrees below\naverage Wednesday with mainly lower and middle 70s for day time\nmaxes, and temperatures Wednesday night running below average \nwith night time mins in the lower 50s across the interior and \nupper 50s closer to the coast. \n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...\nNo significant changes in the long term and stuck fairly close to \nprevious forecast/NBM. \n\nSurface high pressure builds into the region from the Great Lakes on \nThursday and remains in place through much of the weekend. This will \nlead to an extended period of dry weather. A trough exits to the \neast late Thursday and early Friday as a ridge takes over. This will \nlead to gradually warming temperatures. NW flow continues on \nThursday under high pressure keep high temperatures in the upper to \nlow 70s. Upper 70s to lower 80s return on Friday as ridging builds \naloft and surface winds become more westerly, eventually \nsouthwesterly by the afternoon. Westerly to southerly flow continues \ninto the weekend allowing for further warming with highs in the \nlow/mid-80s. \n\nGlobal models are not in a consensus late Sunday into Monday. The \nGFS has a trough develop over the area while the ECMWF have the \ntrough farther displaced from our area, mainly to the northeast then \neast. Only the GFS solution would bring a chance for rain. Given the \ndivergence in model guidance, have kept POPs out of of the ending \nperiods in the extended forecast.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /08Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...\nHigh pressure slowly builds into the region today and tonight.\n\nMainly VFR. There is a chance for an isolated light shower or\nsprinkle overnight. There may also be brief periods of MVFR\nceilings around 2.5-3kft. \n\nWinds will remain NW through the TAF period. Wind speeds around\n10 kt overnight. Winds then increase after day break, becoming \n10-15kt with gusts around 20 kt. The gusts could end up \noccasional and any gusts likely end in the evening.\n\n ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...\n\nCan not rule out an occasional gust early this morning.\n\nMVFR ceilings around 030 possible overnight. \n\nGusts may be occasional today. \n\nOUTLOOK FOR 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...\n\nTuesday Night: A gust G15-20kt possible in the evening. VFR. \n\nWednesday-Saturday: VFR.\n\nDetailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts, \ncan be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nA NW flow prevails in the wake of a cold front. A pressure gradient \nexists with the cold front offshore and building high pressure to \nthe west. Mainly sub small craft conditions, with marginal small \ncraft conditions at times through today for the ocean with gusts to \naround 20 kt which also includes the near shore coastal waters.\nThus have left up a small craft advisory through 16z for the\nwestern and central ocean zones, and until 18z for the eastern\nmost ocean. Otherwise sub small craft conditions prevail for \nTuesday night and through the upcoming weekend as high pressure\nbuilds into the coastal waters.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\nNo hydrological impacts are expected through the entire forecast \nperiod.\n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nA high rip current risk is in place through 8 pm this evening \ndue to elevated, long period swells from Ernesto.\n\nWith a full moon earlier this week and higher astronomical \ntides lingering expect minor coastal flood benchmarks to be \napproached or slightly exceeded for tonight's high tide cycle \nacross SW CT and the south shore bays of Nassau and Queens. This\nis being handled with coastal flood statements. Elsewhere minor\nbenchmarks are not expected to be approached.\n\n&&\n\n.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nCT...None.\nNY...High Risk for Rip Currents through this evening for NYZ075-080-081-\n     178-179.\nNJ...None.\nMARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 2 PM EDT this afternoon for ANZ350.\n     Small Craft Advisory until noon EDT today for ANZ353-355.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nSYNOPSIS...BC/JE\nNEAR TERM...JE\nSHORT TERM...JE\nLONG TERM...BC\nAVIATION...BC\nMARINE...BC/JE\nHYDROLOGY...BC/JE\nTIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\n"

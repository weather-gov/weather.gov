This bit...has ellipses in the middle...but is not an overview.

.After a few days of warm weather, a potent winter storm will bring
windy and colder conditions with periods of heavy snow to the Sierra
and higher elevations of northeast California later this week. While
weather-related travel impacts aren't expected through Wednesday
morning, conditions will begin to worsen Wednesday afternoon and
evening, with the most widespread winter travel impacts likely from
Wednesday evening through much of Thursday.

* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Snow accumulations of 4 to 10 inches
above 5000 feet west of US-395, with 10 to 20 inches possible for
higher passes such as Fredonyer Summit and Yuba Pass. Winds
gusting as high as 50 mph.

* WHERE...Lassen-Eastern Plumas-Eastern Sierra Counties.

* WHEN...From late Wednesday morning through Friday morning.
Heaviest snow is most likely from late Wednesday afternoon through
Thursday morning.

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult at times, with hazardous
conditions impacting the commutes from Wednesday evening through
Friday morning. Strong winds may blow down some tree limbs and a
few power outages may result.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow levels will start near 6500 feet on
Wednesday, then drop to near 5500 feet Wednesday night and near
5000 feet by Thursday morning.`;
